An easy and simple way to hide products in WooCommerce by category when they're out of stock

== Description ==
This plugin will let you hide out of stock products in WooCommerce but only for certain categories. WooCommerce currently lets you either hide all out of stock products or none. This expands on that and lets you choose a category to hide when out of stock.

You might want to use this to keep newer products on your website eventhough they're out of stock. Hiding the older, out of stock WooCommerce products would remove some clutter.

== Installation ==
1. Upload and extract the .zip file downloaded to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Start using the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I set which categories to hide? =
In the individual category settings pages. Navigate to the one you want to hide when out of stock and a checkbox will be at the bottom.

= Does this work with product tags = 
Not yet. This will be in a future version!
